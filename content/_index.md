    The Writing and Rhetoric of Code group was established to bring together
    rhetoric, writing studies, and literacy scholars invested in all things
    coding and programming. WROC meets annually at the Conference on College
    Composition and Communication. As this group is fairly new, we are in the
    process of building WROC bibliographies, a mentorship program, and so much
    more to support our community. 


    If you're interested in joining the WROC mailing list for updates, please contact the Communications Officer: Cara Marta Messina at cmessina@jsu.edu
